    The shadow of the Arena is slowly creeping across your face. The cold air, saturated with the smell of blood and dust, makes you shudder. You're standing on the edge of the arena, in the heart of Gladiator Valley, and your heart is pounding in your chest like a wild beast. Your sword, heavy and cold, fits into your hand confidently, but the feeling of fear does not leave you. You know: the fight for your life is about to begin. 

    Your opponents are small goblins, a little older and younger than you. In their eyes, you don't see fear, but hatred and a desire to kill. They feel your willingness to fight to the end. 

    Here they are, being released in small groups from the depths of the arena. Their leather rags gleam in the sun, and their crooked weapons are made of shoddy iron, but they are sharpened. You raise your sword, and it's not fear that grips you, but a frenzied excitement. 

    The battle begins...

    Press any key... when you ready!
